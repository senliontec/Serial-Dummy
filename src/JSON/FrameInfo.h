/**
 * Defines a JSON frame information structure. We need to use this in order to
 * be able to correctly process all received frames in a thread-worker manner.
 *
 * Every time we receive a frame from the serial/network device, we generate the
 * JSON in another thread in order to avoid putting excessive pressure in the
 * GUI thread.
 *
 * This results in a perceived increase of application performance. However,
 * since each JSON frame is generated in a different worker thread, the main
 * thread may not receive JSON data in the correct order.
 *
 * To mitigate this, we create this structure, which contains the following
 * information:
 *    - Frame number (assigned by the JSON::Generator class when raw frame data
 * is received, and before the JSON object is genereated/parsed).
 *    - RX date/time (assigned in the same manner as the frame number).
 *    - JSON document/object (which contains all the frame information + what we
 * should do with it).
 *
 * We need to register the frame number because (in some cases), the RX
 * date/time will be the same between two or more frames (e.g. if you have a
 * very high baud rate, there is a chance that frames will be registered with
 * the same rx date/time down to the millisecond, this was the root cause of bug
 * #35).
 *
 * To mitigate this, we simply increment the frame number each time that we
 * receive a raw frame. Frame numbers are registered as a uint64_t for this very
 * reason (it would take about 585 years to overflow this variable, if you had a
 * computer that was able to process a frame every nanosecond).
 *
 * Frame number is reset when the device connection state is changed.
